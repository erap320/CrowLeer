### Rules:

CrowLeer uses Regular Expressions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to apply conditions to URLs or parts of URLs.

The Follow and Save rules have a global component, that matches the Completed URL (see the URL section) and one for every URL part.
The Exclude rule only has a global component.

* Follow Rule: describes pages to follow while crawling
* Save Rule: describes pages to download and save locally
* Exclude Rule: describes pages to completely exclude from the crawling

If not specified every rule is set to match anything (with the exclude rule matching nothing). You can set every possible composition of rules to describe the exact scenario you need, including global rule and parts rules together.

### URLs:

CrowLeer completes the URLs found in the crawled pages to make its and your work easier.

Every URL is split in parts and completed with parts from the URL of the page it was found in if necessary.

The parts in which a URL is split are: protocol, domain, path, filename, extension, querystring and anchor.

#### Example

The URL ```"/example/one/file.txt"``` was found while running on ```"https://erap.space"```

The Completed URL will be ```"https://erap.space/example/one/file.txt"```, and its parts will be:

| Part        | Value         |
|-------------|---------------|
| protocol    | "https"       |
| domain      | "erap.space"  |
| path        | "example/one" |
| filename    | "file"        |
| extension   | "txt"         |
| querystring | ""            |
| anchor      | ""            |

#### Example

The URL ```"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog?s=canis#Origin"``` will be split in parts this way:

| Part        | Value              |
|-------------|--------------------|
| protocol    | "https"            |
| domain      | "en.wikipedia.org" |
| path        | "wiki/Dog"         |
| filename    | ""                 |
| extension   | ""                 |
| querystring | "s=canis"          |
| anchor      | "Origin"           |

### Progress information

Every line of the information shown in the console corresponds to the crawling of one URL. The structure of the lines is the following:

```Number of URLs left >> Currently crawled URL : Depth of the URL```

When the saving feature is activated, the URLs of pages that meet the Save Condition will be highlighted in green.

### CURL Options
Since CrowLeer uses CURL to download pages, you can set custom options to fine-tune every detail.
For example, to set a custom User Agent you need to call CrowLeer with the following arguments:

```crowleer -c "CURLOPT_USERAGENT" -p "MyCustomUA"```

__Attention!__ The -c and -p arguments can only be used in this order

It's possible to set how many options you want, by repeating -c and -p arguments. For example:

```crowleer -c "CURLOPT_USERAGENT" -p "MyCustomUA" -c "CURLOPT_INTERFACE" -p "eth0"```

Keep in mind that these options will be set for every request made by the program.

You can find a complete list of CURL options here: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html

### Browsing downloaded pages
If you are saving pages with the ```-S``` flag with the intent of browsing them offline, as a local copy of the crawled website, absolute links in them can make it very difficult.

You can easily solve the problem by adding the ```-r``` flag. It activates Crowleer's "URL relativization" feature, making links point to other local pages instead of real ones.

### Third party libraries

* [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)
* [cpp-netlib URI](https://github.com/cpp-netlib/uri)

## Building
### Windows
Open `CrowLeer.sln` with Visual Studio 2019 or later, and follow the usual build process.

### Linux
Install curl dependencies with your package manager. Here you can find a couple of examples:

- Debian based distros: `sudo apt-get install libcurl-dev`
- Arch based distros: `sudo pacman -S curl`

Then, build the executable by running `make` in the root of this repository.
The resulting executable will be available at `build/crowleer`.
